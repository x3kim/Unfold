  "aboutTitle": "About Unfold",
  "aboutPurposeTitle": "Purpose & Functionality",
  "aboutPurposeP1": "Unfold is a minimalist desktop utility designed to flatten a nested folder structure. It takes a selected folder, recursively finds every file within it and all its subdirectories, and copies them into a single, new folder.",
  "aboutPurposeP2": "This is useful for consolidating files from complex directory trees, for example, collecting all photos from a backup or gathering all documents from a project archive into one place.",
  "aboutFeaturesTitle": "Key Features",
  "aboutFeatureCopy": "<strong>Safe Copying:</strong> The original folder and its files are never modified.",
  "aboutFeatureConflict": "<strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> If files with the same name exist in different subfolders, they are automatically renamed (e.g., <code>[conflict-1]-file.txt</code>) to prevent overwriting.",
  "aboutFeatureLog": "<strong>Detailed Logging:</strong> Every action (copy, rename, error) is documented in a <code>documentation.md</code> file in the output folder.",
  "aboutFeatureUI": "<strong>Modern UI:</strong> Includes a theme switcher, live progress updates, and a multi-language interface.",
