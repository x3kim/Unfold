            <h2>Purpose & Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Unfold is a minimalist desktop utility designed to flatten a nested folder structure. It takes a selected folder, recursively finds every file within it and all its subdirectories, and copies them into a single, new folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is useful for consolidating files from complex directory trees, for example, collecting all photos from a backup or gathering all documents from a project archive into one place.

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safe Copying:</strong> The original folder and its files are never modified.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> If files with the same name exist in different subfolders, they are automatically renamed (e.g., <code>[conflict-1]-file.txt</code>) to prevent overwriting.</li>
                <li><strong>Detailed Logging:</strong> Every action (copy, rename, error) is documented in a <code>documentation.md</code> file in the output folder.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern UI:</strong> Includes a theme switcher, live progress updates, and a multi-language interface.</li>
            </ul>
